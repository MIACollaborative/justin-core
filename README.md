# JustIn Core

The **JustIn Core** package (@just-in/core) is the foundation of the [JustIn Framework](https://miacollaborative.github.io/justin-docs).

Docs for installing and using **JustIn Core** and, eventually, other aspects of the Framework, can be found at the [JustIn Core site](https://miacollaborative.github.io/justin-core).

The fastest and best way to get started with JustIn is to try out one of our [examples](https://github.com/MIACollaborative/justin-examples).
