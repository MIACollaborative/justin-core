## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

Before creating bug reports, please check the [issue tracker](https://github.com/MIACollaborative/justin-core/issues) to see if the bug has already been reported. When creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible:

- A clear and descriptive title.
- Steps to reproduce the behavior.
- Expected behavior vs. actual behavior.
- Screenshots or GIFs (if applicable).
- Your environment (e.g., operating system, browser, version of the software).

### Suggesting Enhancements

We welcome suggestions for new features or improvements. Please use the issue tracker and label your issue as an "enhancement." In your suggestion, please describe:

- The problem you're trying to solve.
- How the enhancement would work.
- Why you think this enhancement would be useful.

### Your First Code Contribution

If you're new to the project and want to make your first code contribution, consider looking for issues labeled "good first issue" or "help wanted." These are often smaller, more straightforward tasks that are great for getting familiar with the codebase.

### Pull Requests

We follow the [Forking Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/forking-workflow) for contributions.

1.  **Fork the repository** on GitHub.
2.  **Clone your forked repository** to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)[YourUsername]/[your-project-name].git
    ```
3.  **Create a new branch** for your changes. Give it a descriptive name (e.g., `fix/bug-in-login`, `feat/new-user-profile`).
    ```bash
    git checkout -b [branch-name]
    ```
4.  **Make your changes**.
5.  **Commit your changes** with a clear and concise commit message. See [Git Commit Messages](#git-commit-messages) for guidelines.
6.  **Push your branch** to your fork on GitHub.
    ```bash
    git push origin [branch-name]
    ```
7.  **Open a Pull Request** from your branch to the `main` branch of the original repository.

Please ensure your pull request description includes:
- A clear title summarizing the changes.
- A detailed explanation of the problem it solves or the feature it adds.
- Any relevant issue numbers (e.g., `Closes #123`).

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

We use a specific format for our commit messages to ensure a readable and consistent history. Please follow the Conventional Commits specification.

- **`feat`**: A new feature
- **`fix`**: A bug fix
- **`docs`**: Documentation only changes
- **`style`**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc.)
- **`refactor`**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **`test`**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- **`chore`**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation

**Example:**
`feat: add user profile page`
`fix: correct login button alignment on mobile`

### Code Style

- We use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for code formatting. Please ensure you run it before committing your changes.
- Linting is handled by [ESLint](https://eslint.org/). All linting errors must be resolved before a pull request can be merged.
- [Additional rules or conventions specific to your project].
